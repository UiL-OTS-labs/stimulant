# stimulant
Python, PIL, Dev for web experiment, placeholder stimuli, gTTs

With all these web experiments to test, it might well be a good idea to have tool to bake:

- Images
- Shapes
- Coordinates
- Sounds
- Video's

This requires quite some packages and is aimed at development, but well...

Python rocks.
